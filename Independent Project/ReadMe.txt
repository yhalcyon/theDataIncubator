The distribution of Data Scientists

Understanding the job market for the data scientists is of significant importance to obtain a job position in the related field. In this project, I obtained the data scientists' information around the world, and further analyzed the geographical distribution of the U.S. data scientists.

My works include the following steps:

1. creating the PERL crawler script to obtain the raw data from the 'Data Science Central' (http://www.datasciencecentral.com/). 

2. Further performing the data clean to get the information of the data scientists that are members in the above central. 

3. Getting the geographical distribution of the data scientists within the United States. 

4. Projecting the distributions on the U.S. map to visualize the data
